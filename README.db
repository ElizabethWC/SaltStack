SaltStack Project

Host Website Needs
* A good name
* An AWS account
* 6 (?) AMIS for different website configurations
* An engaging website with which a customer can...
* * Choose a theme
* * Choose customizations
* * Provide their website content
* * Securely pay
* * Use a chat feature for any questions
* * Press a big green button that launches their website and alerts/sends the setup info to master? Maybe that much automation isn't a good idea atl tleast at first

Launching a Website Template

=== Prerequisites ===

* virtualenv
* boto and boto3 libraries

=== Shared Resources ===
* Security groups (CAN SHARE?)
* * Memcache
* * ALB
* * Wordpress approved for EC2

=== Each website (including host) will need ==
* A VPC
* Subnets
* * Public- how many?
* * Private- how many?
* Route tables
* * Public
